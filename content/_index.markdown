## João Pedro Bazzo Vieira

Hi there!

This is my personal website, where I share my work/interests about vehicle emissions, data analysis, dataViz, bicycles, and, of course, R. \
I am an environmental engineer who is passionate about the interface between transport and the environment. Currently, I'm working at Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA) in the [**Access to Opportunities Project**](https://www.ipea.gov.br/acessooportunidades/en/).

### Education

 M.S. 2020\
Environmental Engineering\
Federal University of Paraná\
 B.S. 2016\
Environmental Engineering\
Federal University of Paraná

### Work in progress

I've been developing an R package to estimate vehicle emissions package based on GTFS data, with Rafael Pereira (IPEA) and Pedro Andrade (INPE). In the AOP project, I've been involved with racial inequalities in access to health opportunities in the major Brazilian cities.
