## João Pedro Bazzo Vieira

I am a PhD student in Civil and Mineral Engineering at the University of Toronto - [at Positive Zero Transport Futures Lab](https://positivezero.civmin.utoronto.ca/). My research broadly focuses on how urban policies and technologies shape human mobility, air quality, and vehicle emissions. I am passionate about data science and its application at the intersection of transport and the environment. Questions such as “*If we switch vehicle technologies or change the way we plan our cities, how would our air quality and emissions change? And how should we measure these impacts?*” are very compelling to me.

In my prior research assistant role with the [Access to Opportunities Project](https://www.ipea.gov.br/acessooportunidades/en/) (AOP) in Brazil, I studied urban mobility trends, inequalities in access to services, and the sustainability of urban form. There, I co-authored 4 peer-reviewed papers, 5 policy reports, and developed 3 open-source R packages. I also contributed to cycling advocacy between 2016 and 2020, supporting initiatives that encouraged more active and sustainable forms of urban mobility.

My main interests lie in sustainable transport, data-driven modeling, and equitable urban transitions. I am particularly motivated by how technological innovations such as electrification, advanced data methods, and machine learning can inform policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions while improving accessibility. Outside academia, I love running in green urban spaces, away from traffic, surrounded by nature and quiet.
