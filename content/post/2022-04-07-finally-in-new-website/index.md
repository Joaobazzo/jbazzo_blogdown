After procrastinating for quite a long time, a finally did a personal blog. I felt it would be quite frustrating to get used to a new programming language or interface, but it turns out to be quite enjoyable — as I create it using RStudio and Github.

I made this blog using this [blogdown tutorial](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) — thanks to the authors Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill! There are several tips on how to get started, examples, and some basic configurations. Also, there are a large number of themes available at https://themes.gohugo.io. Blogdown is for sure an approach I recommend for those who wanted to create a some basic static website :) 

So, yes, finally! I look forward to posting some nice stuff about vehicle emissions, R, and data analysis. 

Cheers!\
JP
